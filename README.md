## 📊 Model Performance

Performance metrics of the YOLOv8l model on the test set:

| Metric       | Value |
|--------------|-------|
| **mAP@50**   | 0.37  |
| **mAP@50-95**| 0.18  |
| **Precision**| 0.46  |
| **Recall**   | 0.26  |

> These results indicate that the model shows early promise for fracture detection and will be further optimized for clinical-grade usage.
